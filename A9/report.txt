The full description of the design and implementation of BLOG is given bellow:
=============================================================================


HOME PAGE:
=========
THis page is the main page of blog. Here We have a nav bar at top and a featured post section where
all featured posts are shown.

In order to make responsive on all deviced I use Bootstrap.



Blog PAGE:
==========
This page holds the recent blogs and a sidebar.
The sidebar has a search bar where user can search post by typing keyword 
and bellow search bar there is a block containing all categories of the blog site.



Single Blog Page:
================
This Page works as a template for all Blog. If anyone click on any blog read more button,
he will be redirected to this page.

Single blog template page has necessary elements to show the blog contents.
These are:
        1)) Image Tag
        2)) Title 
        3)) Author name 
        4)) Blog Content
        5)) Social share icons


Contact Page:
==============
Contact page contains a form where user can given
   1)) name
   2)) email
   3)) subject of message
   4)) details message
After Successful submission, This page refreshed and show a success message.
If any error occured, an error message also displayed on top of the form.   




Process Contact script:
=======================
To process the user form data I use a php script "process_contact.php" .
Here at the begining, a session starts. 
This script grab the form data and save them in a csv file. 
If it able to save the form data successfully, it set the value of the session variable 'success' to 'true' and otherwise 
'false'. And finally redirects to contact.php page.
